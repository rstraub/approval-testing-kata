# Approval Testing Kata

**Goals:**

- Understanding what Approval Testing is
- Where it is useful
- Where it _isn't_ useful
- How to write approval tests

We'll be using the [Approval Tests](https://approvaltests.com) library as an
implementation, but the technique can be achieved in other ways too

## Exercises

Exercises are self-contained in test files.
Start your journey in the
[LegacyPrinterSpec](src/test/scala/nl/codecraftr/scala/kata/LegacyPrinterSpec.scala).

## Questions

- How does approval testing differ from 'good old' unit testing?
- What about approval testing was useful to you? What wasn't?
- In which cases would you use approval testing? When wouldn't you?

Find the answers to these questions in the [summary](summary.md)
